- Use EMNIST_playground to generate the data.

- It also calls some functions from xml_functions to write the xml annotations.

- Download data from https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/emnist and place into a directory called DATA.

- Create folders called Images, Annotations, and Annotations_Simple.

- Also check to make sure you have the right Python libraries. The most obscure one I use is imageio.

- Written in Python3.

- Let me know if there are any problems --> burtonw0814@gmail.com
